A quick project that shows the power of MapBox for Android 


## Step 1 
Integrate MapBox SDK and show current user position

## Step 2 
Add a search bar to query addresses

## Step 3
Search for addresses using the map gesture 

## Step 4
Decided to use sharedpreferences to store the 15 last known location.
It might not be a good solution for performance .. consider using the SqlLite DB.
